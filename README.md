# Square_Simpino_bare_min

## Introduction
The main intention of this circuit is to have only bare minimum components. 
the Entire circuit will be placed in a square form factor, unlike the traditional arduino with rail configuration so that the connection to other components becomes easy. 
 
This design is highly influenced by the FabLab design for the similar circuit, Thanks to MIT fab lab for putting their circuit online.
