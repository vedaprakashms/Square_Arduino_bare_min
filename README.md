# Square_Simpino_bare_min

## Introduction
The main intention of this circuit is to have only bare minimum components. 
the Entire circuit will be placed in a square form factor, unlike the traditional arduino with rail configuration so that the connection to other components becomes easy. 
 
This design is highly influenced by the FabLab design for the similar circuit, Thanks to MIT fab lab for putting their circuit online. 

The entire circuit is plotted on a 50mm X 50mm square so that the form factor remains. 

## To program
### Via ISP
connect the headers connections named on the backside of the board to associated pins on the ISP programmers such as USB ISP or avr isp etc.., Select the programer on the Arduino IDE and hit the program via external programer. 

### Via Bootloader. 
#### For the first time use
